Create roles here, in either the Role Ruby DSL (.rb) or JSON (.json) files. To install roles on the server, use knife.

For example, in this directory you'll find an example role file called `example.json` which can be uploaded to the Chef Server:
    
    knife role from file roles/example.json

For more information on roles, see the Chef wiki page:
