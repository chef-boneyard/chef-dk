    # Fetches cookbooks from a supermarket, similar to CommunityCookbookSource
    # (which it delegates to), except that only the latest versions of any
    # cookbook can be used.
    #
    # This is intended to be used in an environment where the team wants to
    # make only the newest version of a given cookbook available in order to
    # force developers to integrate continuously at the component artifact
    # (cookbook) level. To achieve this goal, two constraints must be imposed:
    #
    # * Cookbook changes pass through a Ci pipeline and are ultimately uploaded
    #   to a private supermarket (or equivalent, i.e. mini-mart) after final
    #   approval (which can be automated or not)
    # * Version numbers for cookbooks that pass through the Ci pipeline always
    #   increase over time (so that largest version number == newest)
    #
    # In the future, alternative approaches may be persued to achieve the goal
    # of continuously integrating at the cookbook level without imposing those
    # constraints.
