# at least prevent downgrades beyond that:
gem "appbundler", github: "chef/appbundler" # until next release with multiple-gem support
gem "berkshelf"
# Chef 12.8.1 Gem includes some extra files which can break gem installation on
# windows. For now we are pulling chef from github at the tag as a workaround.
