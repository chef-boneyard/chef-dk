# NOTE: NO GEM DEPENDENCIES
#
# we do not add dependencies here on omnibus-software definitions that install gems.
#
# all of the gems for chef-dk must be installed in the mega bundle install below.
#
# doing bundle install / rake install in dependent software definitions causes gemsets
# to get solved without some of the chef-dk constraints, which results in multiple different
# versions of gems in the omnibus bundle.
#
# for gems that depend on c-libs, we include the c-libraries directly here.
