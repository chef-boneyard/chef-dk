# `json_pure` has a bug in it that is failing ChefDK builds.  We include the
# json gem into the Gemfile so that running `bundle exec` will have
# this gem on the load path, and cause `require "json/ext"` to succeed.  This
# prevents loading the `json_pure` gem

# pedump pessimistically pins multipart-post to a version from 2013 which makes
# bundler very unhappy. Remove this when upstream has merged zed-0xff/pedump#6 .

# This development group is installed by default when you run `bundle install`,

# the Test Kitchen-based build lab. You can skip these unnecessary dependencies
# by running `bundle install --without development` to speed up build times.
