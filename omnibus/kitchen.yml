  # The following (private) boxes are shared via Vagrant Cloud and are only
  # available to users working for Chef. Sorry, it's about software licensing.
  #
  # Chef-internal users, you will need to:
  # 1.  Create an Vagrant Cloud account:  http://vagrantcloud.com/
  # 2.  Ping #releng-support with your account name to be added to the relevant team.
  # 3.  Do `vagrant login` with your creds so that you can download the private boxes.
  #
  # The macOS boxes are VMware only also. You can enable VMware Fusion
  # by activating the `kitchen.vmware.yml` file with the `KITCHEN_LOCAL_YAML`
  # environment variable:
