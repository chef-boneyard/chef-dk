* `inspec`: 2.2.70 -> 2.2.112
* `kitchen-inspec`: 0.23.1 -> 0.24.0
* `kitchen-vagrant`: 1.3.3 -> 1.3.4

## Deprecations

* `chef generate app` - Application repos were a pattern that didn't take off.
* `chef generate lwrp` - Use `chef generate resource`. Every supported release of Chef knows about custom resources. Custom resources are awesome. No one should be writing new LWRPs any more. LWRPS are not awesome.

# ChefDK 3.2 Release Notes

## Chef 14.4.56

ChefDK now ships with Chef 14.4.56. See <https://docs.chef.io/release_notes.html> for more information on what's new.

## Updated Operating System support

ChefDK now ships packages for Ubuntu 18.04 and Debian 9. In accordance with Chef's platform End Of Life policy, ChefDK is no longer shipped on macOS 10.10.

## Enhanced cookbook archive handling

ChefDK now uses an embedded copy of libarchive to support Policyfile and Berkshelf. This improves overall performance and provides a well tested interface to many different types of archives. It also resolves the long standing "not an octal string" problem users face when depending on certain cookbooks in the supermarket.

## Policyfiles: updated `include_policy` support

Policyfiles now support git targets for included policies.

```

               path: 'policies/base/Policyfile.lock.json'
```

## Policyfiles: `chef update` gains `--exclude-deps` flag

When using this, behavior is very strict: it updates only the cookbook(s)
mentioned on command line.

## Updated Tooling

### Test Kitchen

Test Kitchen has been updated from 1.20.0 to 1.21.2. This release allows you to use a kitchen.yml config file instead of .kitchen.yml so the kitchen config will no longer be hidden in your cookbook directories.

The update also adds 9 new rules for writing custom resources and updating cookbooks to Chef 13 and 14, resolves several long standing file detection bugs, and improves performance.

### Cookstyle

Cookstyle has been updated to 3.0, which updates the underlying RuboCop engine to 0.55 with a long list of bug fixes and improvements.

# ChefDK 2.4 Release Notes

## Improved Performance Downloading Cookbooks from a Chef Server

Policyfile users who use a Chef Server as a cookbook source will experience faster cookbook downloads when running `chef install`. Chef Server's API requires each file in a cookbook to be downloaded separately; ChefDK will now download the files in parallel. Additionally, HTTP keepalives are enabled to reduce connection overhead.

## Cookbook Artifact Source for Policyfiles

Policyfile users may now source cookbooks from the Chef Server's cookbook artifact store. This is mainly intended to support the upcoming `include_policy` feature, but could be useful in some situations.

Given a cookbook that has been uploaded to the Chef Server via `chef push`, it can be used in another policy by adding code like the following to the ruby policyfile:

```
cookbook "runit",
  chef_server_artifact: "https://chef.example/organizations/myorg",
  identifier: "09d43fad354b3efcc5b5836fef5137131f60f974"
```

## Add include_policy directive
Policyfile maybe now use the `include_policy` directive as described in
[RFC097](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc097-policyfile-includes.md).
This directive's purpose is to allow the inclusion policyfile locks to the current
policyfile. In this iteration, we support sourcing lock files from a local path or a
chef server. Below is a simple example of how the `include_policy` directive can be used.

Given a policyfile `base.rb`:
```
name 'base'

default_source :supermarket

run_list 'motd'

cookbook 'motd', '~> 0.6.0'
```

Run:
```
>> chef install ./base.rb

Building policy base
Expanded run list: recipe[motd]
Caching Cookbooks...
Using      motd         0.6.4
Using      chef_handler 3.0.2

Lockfile written to /home/jaym/workspace/chef-dk/base.lock.json
Policy revision id: 1238e7a353ec07a4df6636cdffd8805220a00789bace96d6d70268a4b0064023
```

This will produce the `base.lock.json` that will be included in our next policy `users.rb`:
```
name 'users'

default_source :supermarket

run_list 'user'

cookbook 'user', '~> 0.7.0'

include_policy 'base', path: './base.lock.json'
```

Run:
```
>> chef install ./users.rb

Building policy users
Expanded run list: recipe[motd::default], recipe[user]
Caching Cookbooks...
Using      motd         0.6.4
Installing user         0.7.0
Using      chef_handler 3.0.2

Lockfile written to /home/jaym/workspace/chef-dk/users.lock.json
Policy revision id: 20fac68f987152f62a2761e1cfc7f1dc29b598303bfb2d84a115557e2a4a8f27
```

This will produce a `users.lock.json` that has the `base` policyfile lock merged in.

More information can be found in
[RFC097](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc097-policyfile-includes.md) and
the [docs](https://docs.chef.io/policyfile.htm://docs.chef.io/policyfile.html).
