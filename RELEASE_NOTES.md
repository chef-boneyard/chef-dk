# ChefDK 4.7

## Updated Components

### Chef Infra Client

Chef Infra Client has been updated from 15.5 to 15.6 which includes improvements to the `apt_repository`, `file`, `user`, and `yum_repository` resources as well as the usual collection of bug fixes.

### Cookstyle

Cookstyle has been updated from 5.13 to 5.19 with 29 new cops, improvements to existing cops, a new TargetChefVersion config option, and expanded cop departments.

#### TargetChefVersion Config

Cookstyle now includes a new top-level configuration option `TargetChefVersion`. This new configuration option works similarly to RuboCop's `TargetRubyVersion` config option and allows you to specify a Chef Infra version that you want to target in your Cookstyle analysis. This prevents Cookstyle from autocorrecting cookbook code in a way that would make your cookbook incompatible with your desired Chef Infra Client version. It also makes it easier to perform staged upgrades of the Chef Infra Client by allowing you to step the `TargetChefVersion` one major version at a time.

Example .rubocop.yml config specifying a TargetChefVersion of 14.0:

```yaml
AllCops:
  TargetChefVersion: 14.0
```

#### New ChefSharing and ChefRedundantCode Departments

Cookstyle now includes two new Chef cop departments with a large number of existing cops moved into these more appropriate departments. Our goal is to have clearly defined cop departments that can be enabled or disabled to detect particular conditions in your cookbooks. Cops in the new ChefSharing department are focused around sharing cookbooks internally or on the public Supermarket. This includes things like ensuring proper license strings and complete metadata. Cops in the ChefRedundantCode category detect and correct unnecessary cookbook code. Anything detected by ChefRedundantCode cops can be removed regardless of the Chef Infra Client release you run in your infrastructure, so these are always safe to run.

With the addition of these new departments, we've moved many cops out of the ChefCorrectness department. Going forward only cops that detect code that may fail a Chef Infra Client run or cause it to behave incorrectly will be included in this category. We hope that ChefCorrectness along with ChefDeprecations are used in most cookbook CI pipelines.

### kitchen-azurerm

kitchen-azurerm has been updated from 0.14.9 to 0.15.1 with the following improvements:

- Enable the WinRM HTTP listener by default. Thanks [@sean-nixon](https//github.com/sean-nixon)

This release includes bug fixes from [@MarkGibbons](https://github.com/MarkGibbons) and [@jeremy-clerc](https://github.com/jeremy-clerc) as well as a new way to update existing keys to sparse-mode by running `knife vault update --keys_mode sparse` thanks to [@jeunito](https://github.com/jeunito).

### kitchen-ec2

kitchen-ec2 has been updated to 3.3.0. This new version improves how we search for security groups by tags, improves the logic that detects usage of the chef Test Kitchen provisioner, and improves security group and spot instance logic. Thanks [@slapvanilla](https://github.com/slapvanilla) and [@bdwyertech](https://github.com/bdwyertech) for these enhancements.

## Performance Improvements

This release of ChefDK ships with several optimizations to our Ruby installation to improve the performance of loading the various commands bundled with ChefDK. These improvements are particularly noticeable on non-SSD hosts and on Windows.

# ChefDK 4.6

## Updated Components

### Chef Infra Client

The Chef Infra Client has been updated from 15.4.45 to 15.5.17 with updated helpers, Chefignore improvements, and a new chef_sleep resource:

#### New Cookbook Helpers

Chef Infra Client now includes a new `chef-utils` gem which ships with a large number of helpers to make writing cookbooks easier. Many of these helpers existed previously in the `chef-sugar` gem. We have renamed many of the named helpers for consistency while providing backwards compatibility with existing `chef-sugar` names. Existing cookbooks written with `chef-sugar` should work unmodified with any of these new helpers. Expect a Cookstyle rule in the near future to help you update existing `chef-sugar` code to use the newer built-in helpers.

For more information on all of the new helpers available, see the [chef-utils readme](https://github.com/chef/chef/blob/master/chef-utils/README.md)

#### Chefignore Improvements

We've reworked how chefignore files are handled in `knife` which has allowed us to close out a large number of long outstanding bugs. `knife` will now traverse all the way up the directory structure looking for a chefignore file. This means you can place a chefignore file in each cookbook or any parent directory in your repository structure. Additionally, we have made fixes that ensure that commands like `knife diff` and `knife cookbook upload` always honor your chefignore files.

#### chef_sleep Resource

The new `chef_sleep` resource can be used to sleep for a specified number of seconds during a Chef Infra Client run. This may be helpful to use with other commands that return a completed status before they are actually ready. In general, do not use this resource unless you truly need it.

Using with a Windows service that starts, but is not immediately ready:

```ruby
service 'Service that is slow to start and reports as started' do
  service_name 'my_database'
  action :start
  notifies :sleep, chef_sleep['wait for service start']
end

chef_sleep 'wait for service start' do
  seconds 30
  action :nothing
end
```

### Cookstyle

The Cookstyle cookbook linter has been updated from 5.9 to 5.13 and includes 28 new Chef cops for detecting deprecated and outdated cookbook code. This release also updates the underlying RuboCop engine used by Cookstyle which includes a large number of bug fixes that better detect violations and prevent false positives. See the [Cookstyle Release Notes](https://github.com/chef/cookstyle/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.md#cookstyle-513) for a complete list of changes between 5.9 and 5.13.

This new release also allows you to use `cookstyle` specific comments in your cookbook code to enable or disable cops instead of the standard `rubocop` comments. We think that it will be easier to understand the cops that you intend to control if you use `cookstyle` comments. You can continue to use the existing `rubocop` comments, if you prefer them, since both types of comments will be honored by Cookstyle.

Rubocop comment to disable a cop:

```ruby
'node.normal[:foo] # rubocop: disable ChefCorrectness/Bar'
```

Cookstyle comment to disable a cop:

```ruby
'node.normal[:foo] # cookstyle: disable ChefCorrectness/Bar'
```

### Foodcritic

Foodcritic has been updated from 16.1.1 to 16.2.0. This release includes a fix for detecting incorrect notification actions and ships with updated Chef Infra Client Metadata. Keep in mind that Foodcritic is no longer being actively developed and users should migrate to Cookstyle instead.

### Chef InSpec

Chef InSpec has been updated from 4.18.0 to 4.18.39. This release includes a large number of bug fixes to resources:

- The `service` resource now includes a `startname` property for Windows and systemd services.
- The `nginx` resource now includes parsing support for wildcard, dot prefix, and regex.
- The `iis_app_pool` resource now handles empty app pools.
- The `filesystem` resource now supports devices with very long names.
- The `apt` better handles URIs and supports repos with an `arch`.
- The `oracledb_session` has received multiple fixes to make it work better.

### Test Kitchen

We updated Test Kitchen has to 2.3.4, which includes more robust code for finding the Chef binary on Windows and also improves some logging messages.

### knife-ec2

The `knife-ec2` plugin has been updated from 1.0.16 to 1.0.17 which includes a fix for an error when launching non-T2 type instances.

### kitchen-digitalocean

kitchen-digitalocean has been updated to 0.10.5 which adds new image aliases for Debian-10 and FreeBSD-12.

### kitchen-dokkken

kitchen-dokken has been updated to 2.8.0. This will make the CI and TEST_KITCHEN environmental variables match the behavior of kitchen-vagrant.

### kitchen-inspec

We updated the kitchen-inspec plugin to 1.3.1, which allows relative paths in the GIT fetcher and resolves failures when using inputs.

## Performance Improvements

This release of ChefDK ships with several optimizations to our Ruby installation that improve the performance of the included commands, especially on Windows systems. Expect to see more here in future releases.

## Security Updates

libxlst was updated from 1.1.30 to 1.1.34 to resolve these vulnerabilities:

- [CVE-2019-11068](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2019-11068/)

#### New Features

- We have released our beta Chef InSpec plug-in for HashiCorp Vault. Check it out in our [inspec-vault GitHub repo](https://github.com/inspec/inspec-vault) and let us know what you think -- or better yet, start jumping in and contributing with us on it.
- Waivers, our new beta feature, was added to InSpec! Waivers allows you to better manage compliance failures. We would love to hear your feedback on this! See the [InSpec Waivers documentation](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/waivers/) for more details.

#### Improvements

- The `interface` resource now has a name property.
- Expanded `user` resource to include the passwordage, maxbadpasswords, and badpasswordattempts properties with Windows.
- The `sys_info` resource now supports ip_address, fqdn, domain, and short options when giving a version of the hostname.
- Sped up initial load/response time for all commands by removing pre-leading of resources on invocation of inspec.
- If an error occurs when using the `json` resource with a command source, you will now get the error message from STDERR returned in the report.
- We improved the formatting of the usage help, so what you see when you type `inspec exec --help` should look better!

### Cookstyle

Cookstyle has been updated from 5.6.2 to 5.9.3, which includes 13 new Chef cops, improved detection in existing cops, and improved autocorrection. See the [Cookstyle 5.7, 5.8, and 5.9 release notes](https://github.com/chef/cookstyle/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.md) for additional information on the new cops.

### knife-google

knife-google was updated from 4.1.0 to 4.2.0 with support for adding multiple local SSD interfaces to a new instance.

### knife-vsphere

# ChefDK 4.4

## Updated Components

### Chef Infra Client

Chef Infra Client has been updated from 15.2 to 15.3 with updated resources, a new way to write streamlined custom resources, and updated platform support! See the [Chef Infra Client 15.3 Release Notes](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-15-3-14-released/15909) for a complete list of the new and improved functionality.

### Chef InSpec

Chef InSpec has been updated from 4.10.4 to 4.16.0 with the following changes:

- A new `postfix_conf` has been added for inspecting Postfix configuration files.
- A new `plugins` section has been added to the InSpec configuration file which can be used to pass secrets or other configurations into Chef InSpec plugins.

See the [Chef InSpec 4.16.0 Release Notes](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-inspec-4-16-0-released/15818) for more information.

### Cookstyle

Cookstyle has been updated from 5.1.19 to 5.6.2. This update brings the total number of Chef cops to 94 and divides the cops into four separate departments. The new departments make it easier to search for specific cops, and to enable and disable groups of cops. Instead of just "Chef", we now have the following departments:

- `ChefDeprecations`: Cops that detect, and in many cases correct, deprecations that will prevent cookbooks from running on modern versions of Chef Infra Client.
- `ChefStyle`: Cops that will help you improve the format and readability of your cookbooks.
- `ChefModernize`: Cops that will help you modernize your cookbooks by including features introduced in new releases of Chef Infra Client.
- `ChefEffortless`: Cops that will help you migrate your cookbooks to the Effortless pattern. These are disabled by default.

You can run cookstyle with just a single department:

```bash
cookstyle --only ChefDeprecations
```

You can also exclude a specific department from the command line:

```bash
cookstyle --except ChefStyle
```

You can also disable a specific department by adding the following to your .rubocop.yml config:

```yaml
ChefStyle:
  Enabled: false
```

See the [Cookstyle cops documentation](https://github.com/chef/cookstyle/blob/master/docs/cops.md) for a complete list of cops included in Cookstyle 5.6.

Going forward, Cookstyle will be our sole Ruby and Chef Infra cookbook linting tool. With the release of Cookstyle 5.6, we're officially deprecating Foodcritic and will not be shipping Foodcritic in the next major release of Chef Workstation (April 2020). See our [Goodbye, Foodcritic blog post](https://blog.chef.io/goodbye-foodcritic/) for more information on why Cookstyle is replacing Foodcritic.

### kitchen-ec2

`kitchen-ec2` has been updated from 3.1.0 to 3.2.0. This adds support for Windows Server 2019 and adds the ability to look up security group by `subnet_filter` in addition to `subnet_id`.

### kitchen-inspec

`kitchen-inspec` has been updated from 1.1.0 to 1.2.0. This renames the `attrs` key to `input_files`, and the `attributes` key to `inputs` to match InSpec 4. The old names are still supported, but issue a warning.

### knife-ec2

`knife-ec2` has been updated from 1.0.12 to 1.0.16. This resolves the following issues:

* Add `keepalive_maxcount` setting for better control of ssh connection timeouts.
* Add `lifecycle_hooks` information to `kitchen diagnose` output.

### knife-google

The knife-google plugin has been updated to 4.1.0 with support for bootstrapping Chef Infra Client 15, and also includes a new `knife google image list command`, which lists project and public images.

For example `knife google image list --gce_project "chef-msys"`:

```
  NAME                             PROJECT        FAMILY         DISK SIZE  STATUS

### Cookstyle 5.0.0

Cookstyle has been updated to 5.0.0 with a large number of bugfixes and major improvements that lay the groundwork for future autocorrecting of cookobook style and deprecation warnings.

The RuboCop engine that powers Cookstyle has been updated from 0.62 to 0.72, which includes several hundred bugfixes to the codebase. Due to some of these bugfixes, existing cookbooks may fail when using Cookstyle 5.0. Additionally, some cops have had their names changed and the Rubocop Performance cops have been removed. If you disabled individual cops in your .rubocop.yml file, this may require you to update your confg.

This new release also merges in code from the `rubocop-chef` project, providing new alerting and autocorrecting capabilities specific to Chef Infra Cookbooks. Thank you [@coderanger](http://github.com/coderanger) for your work in the rubocop-chef project and [@chrishenry](http://github.com/chrishenry) for helping with new cops.

### Foodcritic 16.1.1

Foodcritic has been updated from 16.0.0 to 16.1.1 with new rules and support for the latest Chef:

- Updated Chef Infra Client metadata for 15.1 to include the new `chocolatey_feature` resources, as well as new properties in the `launchd` and `chocolatey_source` resources
- Added new rule to detect large files shipped in a cookbook: `FC123: Content of a cookbook file is larger than 1MB`. Thanks [@mattray](http://github.com/mattray)
- Allowed configuring the size of the AST cache with a new `--ast-cache-size` command line option. Thanks [@Babar](http://github.com/Babar)

### ChefSpec 7.4.0

ChefSpec has been updated to 7.4 with better support stubbing commands, and a new `policyfile_path` configuration option for specifying the path to the PolicyFile.

### kitchen-dokken 2.7.0

kitchen-dokken has been updated to 2.7.0 with new options for controlling how containers are setup and pulled. You can now disable user namespace mode when running privileged containers with a new `userns_host` config option. There is also a new option `pull_chef_image` (true/false) to control force-pulling the chef image on each run to check for newer images. This option now defaults to `true` so that testing on latest and current always actually mean latest and current. See the [kitchen-dokken readme](https://github.com/someara/kitchen-dokken/blob/master/README.md) for `kitchen.yml` config examples.

### kitchen-digitalocean 0.10.4

kitchen-digitalocean has been updated to 0.10.4 with support for new distros and additional configuration options for instance setup. You can now control the default DigitalOcean region systems that are spun up by using a new `DIGITALOCEAN_REGION` env var. You can still modify the region in the driver section of your `kitchen.yml` file if you'd like, and the default region of `nyc1` has not changed. This release also adds slug support for `fedora-29`, `fedora-30`, and `ubuntu-19`. Finally, if you'd like to monitor your test instances, the new `monitoring` configuration option in the `kitchen.yml` driver section allows enabling DigitalOcean's instance monitoring. See the [kitchen-digitalocean readme](https://github.com/test-kitchen/kitchen-digitalocean/blob/master/README.md) for `kitchen.yml` config examples.

### knife-vsphere 3.0.0

knife-vsphere has been updated to 3.0. This new version adds support for specifying the `bootstrap_template` when creating new VMs. This release also improves how the plugin finds VM hosts, in order to support hosts in nested directories.

### knife-ec2 1.0.7

knife-ec2 has received a near-complete rewrite with this release of ChefDK. The new knife-ec2 release switches the underlying library used to communicate with AWS from `fog-aws` to Amazon's own `aws-sdk`. The official AWS SDK has greatly improved support for the many AWS authentication methods available to users. It also has support for all of the latest AWS regions and instance types. As part of this switch to the new SDK we did have to remove the `knife ec2 flavor list` command as this used hard coded values from fog-aws and not AWS API calls. The good news is, we were able to add several new commands to the plugin. This makes provisioning systems in AWS even easier.

#### knife ec2 vpc list

This command lists all VPCs in your environment including the ID, which you need when provisioning new systems into a specific VPC.

```
$ knife ec2 vpc list
ID            State      CIDR Block     Instance Tenancy  DHCP Options ID  Default VPC?
vpc-b1bc8d9d  available  10.0.0.0/16    default           dopt-1d78412a    No
vpc-daafd931  available  172.0.0.0/16   default           dopt-1d78412a    Yes
```

#### knife ec2 eni list

This command lists all ENIs in your environment including the ID, which you need when adding the ENI to a newly provisioned instance.

```
$ knife ec2 eni list
ID                     Status  AZ          Public IP       Private IPs    IPv6 IPs  Subnet ID        VPC ID
eni-0123f25ae7805b651  in-use  us-west-2a  63.192.209.236  10.0.0.204               subnet-4ef3b123  vpc-b1bc8d9d
eni-2451c913           in-use  us-west-2a  137.150.209.123 10.0.0.245               subnet-4ef3b123  vpc-b1bc8d9d
```

#### knife ec2 securitygroup list

This command lists all security groups in your environment including the ID, which you need when assigning a newly provisioned instance to a group.

```
$knife ec2 securitygroup list
ID                    Name                                     VPC ID
sg-12332d875a4a123d6  not-today-hackers                        vpc-dbbf59a2
sg-123708ab12388cac5  open-to-the-world                        vpc-dbbf59a2
```

#### knife ec2 subnet list

This command lists all subnets in your environment including the ID, which you need when placing a newly provisioned instance in a subnet.

```
$ knife ec2 subnet list
ID               State      CIDR Block      AZ          Available IPs  AZ Default?  Maps Public IP?  VPC ID
subnet-bd2333a9  available  172.31.0.0/20   us-west-2b  4091           Yes          Yes              vpc-b1bc8d9d
subnet-ba1135c9  available  172.31.16.0/20  us-west-2a  4091           Yes          Yes              vpc-b1bc8d9d
```

## End of Ubuntu 14.04 support

Ubuntu 14.04 entered the end-of-life phase April 30, 2019. Since this version of Ubuntu is now end-of-life, we have stopped building packages for Ubuntu 14.04. If you rely on Ubuntu 14.04 in your environment, we highly recommend upgrading your host to Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04.

# ChefDK 4.0 Release Notes

## Breaking Changes

### Chef EULA

Usage of ChefDK 4.0, Chef Infra Client 15, and InSpec 4 requires accepting the [Chef EULA](https://docs.chef.io/chef_license.html#chef-eula). See the [frequently asked questions](https://www.chef.io/bmc-faq/) for information about the license update and the associated business model change.

### Chef Provisioning

Chef Provisioning is no longer included with Chef DK, and will be officially end of life on August 31, 2019. The source code of Chef Provisioning and the drivers have been moved into the chef-boneyard GitHub organization and will not be further maintained. Current users of Chef Provisioning should contact your Chef Customer Success Manager or Account Representative to review your options.

### `knife bootstrap` against cloud providers

`knife bootstrap` was [rewritten](https://github.com/chef/chef/blob/cfbb01cb5648297835941679bc9638d3a823ad5e/RELEASE_NOTES.md#knife-bootstrap) in Chef Infra Client 15.
The `knife-*` cloud providers need to be updated to use this new API.
As of ChefDK 4.0, `knife bootstrap` functionality against the cloud providers will be broken.
We will fix this ASAP in a ChefDK 4.1 release.
The only gem *not* affected is the `knife-windows` gem.
It has already been re-written to leverage the new bootstrap library.

Affected gems:
* `knife-ec2`
* `knife-google`
* `knife-vsphere`

If you leverage this functionality, please wait to update ChefDK until 4.1 is released with fixes for these gems.

## Improved Chef Generate command

The `chef generate` command has been updated to produce cookbooks and repositories that match Chef's best practices.
  - `chef generate repo` now generates a Chef repository with Policyfiles by default. You can revert to the previous roles / environment behavior with the `--roles` flag.
  - `chef generate cookbook` now generates a cookbook with a Policyfile and no Berksfile by default. You can revert to the previous behavior with the `--berks` flag.
  - `chef generate cookbook` now includes ChefSpecs that utilize the ChefSpec 7.3+ format. This is a much simpler syntax that requires less updating of specs as older platforms are deprecated.
  - `chef generate cookbook` no longer creates cookbook files with the unecessary `frozen_string_literal: true` comments.
  - `chef generate cookbook` no longer generates a full Workflow (Delivery) build cookbook by default. A new `--workflow` flag has been added to allow generating the build cookbook. This flag replaces the previously unused `--delivery` flag.
  - `chef generate cookbook` now generates cookbooks with metadata requiring Chef 14 or later.
  - `chef generate cookbook --kitchen dokken` now generates a fully working kitchen-dokken config.
  - `chef generate cookbook` now generates Test Kitchen configs with the `product_name`/`product_version` method of specifying Chef Infra Client releases as `require_chef_omnibus` will be removed in the next major Test Kitchen release.
  - `chef generate cookbook_file` no longer places the specified file in a "default" folder as these aren't needed in Chef Infra Client 12 and later.
  - `chef generate repo` no longer outputs the full Chef Infra Client run information while generating the repository. Similar to the `cookbook` command you can view this verbose output with the `--verbose` flag.

## Updated Components and Tools

### Chef InSpec 4

Chef InSpec has been updated to 4.3.2 which includes the new InSpec AWS resource pack with **59** new AWS resources, multi-region support, and named credentials support. This release also includes support for auditing systems that use `ed25519` SSH keys.

### Chef Infra Client 15

Chef Infra Client has been updated to Chef 15 with **8** new resources, target mode prototype functionality, `ed25519` SSH key support, and more. See the [Chef Infra Client 15 Release Notes](https://github.com/chef/chef/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.md#chef-infra-client-150293) for more details.

### Fauxhai 7.3

Fauxhai has been updated from 6.11 to 7.3. This removes all platforms that were previously marked as deprecated. So if you've noticed deprecation warnings during your ChefSpec tests, you will need to update those specs for the latest [supported Faxhai platforms](https://github.com/chefspec/fauxhai/blob/master/PLATFORMS.md). This release also adds the following new platform releases for testing in ChefSpec:
  - RHEL 6.10 and 8.0
  - openSUSE 15.0
  - CentOS 6.10
  - Debian 9.8 / 9.9

The newer release does remove support for the legacy Librarian depsolver and testing of Chef Infra Client 10/11 releases in some scenarios. See the [Test Kitchen Release Notes](https://github.com/test-kitchen/test-kitchen/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.md#test-kitchen-22-release-notes) for additional details on this release.

### Kitchen-ec2 3.0

Kitchen-ec2 has been updated to 3.0, which uses the newer `aws-sdk-v3` and includes a large number of improvements to the driver including improved hostname detection, backoff retries, additional security group configuration options, and more. See the [kitchen-ec2 Changelog](https://github.com/test-kitchen/kitchen-ec2/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v300-2019-05-01) for additional details.

### kitchen-dokken 2.6.9

Kitchen-dokken has been updated to 2.6.9 with a new config option `pull_platform_image`, which allows you to disable pulling the platform Docker image on every Test Kitchen converge / test. This is particularly useful for local platform image testing.

kitchen.yml example:
```yaml
driver:
  name: dokken
  pull_platform_image: false
```

# ChefDK 3.11 Release Notes

## Chef Infra Client 14.13.11

  - A new `--fail-fast` command line flag for use with the `concurrency` flag. With this flag set, Test Kitchen will immediately fail when any converge fails instead of continuing to test additional instances.
  - The `policyfile_path` config option now accepts relative paths.
  - A new `berksfile_path` config option allows specifying Berkshelf files in non-standard locations.
  - Retries are now honored when using SSH proxies

## kitchen-dokken 2.7.0
  - The Chef Docker image is now pulled by default so that locally cached `latest` or `current` container versions will be compared to those available on DockerHub. See the [readme](https://github.com/someara/kitchen-dokken#disable-pulling-chef-docker-images) for instructions on reverting to the previous behavior.
  - User namespace mode can be disabled when running privileged containers with a new `userns_host` config option. See the [readme](https://github.com/someara/kitchen-dokken#running-with-user-namespaces-enabled) for details.
  - You can now disable pulling the platform Docker images for local platform image testing or air gapped testing. See the [readme](https://github.com/someara/kitchen-dokken#disable-pulling-platform-docker-images) for details.

# ChefDK 3.3 Release Notes

## Chef 14.5.33

ChefDK now ships with Chef 14.5.33. See <https://docs.chef.io/release_notes.html> for more information on what's new.

## New Functionality

* New option: `chef update --exclude-deps` for policyfiles will only update the cookbook(s) given on the command line.

## Updated Tooling

### ChefSpec

ChefSpec 7.3.2 greatly simplifies the syntax as well as allows testing of custom resources.
See the [README](https://github.com/chefspec/chefspec/blob/v7.3.2/README.md) and especially the section on
[testing custom resoures](https://github.com/chefspec/chefspec/blob/v7.3.2/README.md#testing-a-custom-resource) for
examples of the new syntax.

## Updated Components and Tools

* `chef-provisioning-aws`: 3.0.4 -> 3.0.6
* `chef-vault`: 3.3.0 -> 3.4.2
* `foodcritic`: 14.0.0 -> 14.1.0
* `inspec`: 2.2.70 -> 2.2.112
* `kitchen-inspec`: 0.23.1 -> 0.24.0

# ChefDK 2.4 Release Notes

## Improved Performance Downloading Cookbooks from a Chef Server

Policyfile users who use a Chef Server as a cookbook source will experience faster cookbook downloads when running `chef install`. Chef Server's API requires each file in a cookbook to be downloaded separately; ChefDK will now download the files in parallel. Additionally, HTTP keepalives are enabled to reduce connection overhead.

## Cookbook Artifact Source for Policyfiles

Policyfile users may now source cookbooks from the Chef Server's cookbook artifact store. This is mainly intended to support the upcoming `include_policy` feature, but could be useful in some situations.

Given a cookbook that has been uploaded to the Chef Server via `chef push`, it can be used in another policy by adding code like the following to the ruby policyfile:

```
cookbook "runit",
  chef_server_artifact: "https://chef.example/organizations/myorg",
  identifier: "09d43fad354b3efcc5b5836fef5137131f60f974"
```

## Add include_policy directive
Policyfile maybe now use the `include_policy` directive as described in
[RFC097](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc097-policyfile-includes.md).
This directive's purpose is to allow the inclusion policyfile locks to the current
policyfile. In this iteration, we support sourcing lock files from a local path or a
chef server. Below is a simple example of how the `include_policy` directive can be used.

Given a policyfile `base.rb`:
```
name 'base'

default_source :supermarket

run_list 'motd'

cookbook 'motd', '~> 0.6.0'
```

Run:
```
>> chef install ./base.rb

Building policy base
Expanded run list: recipe[motd]
Caching Cookbooks...
Using      motd         0.6.4
Using      chef_handler 3.0.2

Lockfile written to /home/jaym/workspace/chef-dk/base.lock.json
Policy revision id: 1238e7a353ec07a4df6636cdffd8805220a00789bace96d6d70268a4b0064023
```

This will produce the `base.lock.json` that will be included in our next policy `users.rb`:
```
name 'users'

default_source :supermarket

run_list 'user'

cookbook 'user', '~> 0.7.0'

include_policy 'base', path: './base.lock.json'
```

Run:
```
>> chef install ./users.rb

Building policy users
Expanded run list: recipe[motd::default], recipe[user]
Caching Cookbooks...
Using      motd         0.6.4
Installing user         0.7.0
Using      chef_handler 3.0.2

Lockfile written to /home/jaym/workspace/chef-dk/users.lock.json
Policy revision id: 20fac68f987152f62a2761e1cfc7f1dc29b598303bfb2d84a115557e2a4a8f27
```

This will produce a `users.lock.json` that has the `base` policyfile lock merged in.

More information can be found in
[RFC097](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc097-policyfile-includes.md) and
the [docs](https://docs.chef.io/policyfile.htm://docs.chef.io/policyfile.html).
