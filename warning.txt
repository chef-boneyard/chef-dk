Thanks for installing chef-dk! Unfortunately, since Chef Development Kit is
supposed to be installed as the omnibus binaries in order to support vairous
platforms, this is not the official way to install chef-dk.

Please download the latest version for your operatin system from the URL below,
and make sure you have uninstalled your chef-dk gem to avoid conflicts:

You can still use the gem version, but note that it can be out of date.
