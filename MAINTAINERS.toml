This file lists how the ChefDK project is maintained. When making changes to the system, this
file tells you who needs to review your patch - you need a simple majority of maintainers
for the relevant subsystems to provide a :+1: on your pull request. Additionally, you need
to not receive a veto from a Lieutenant or the Project Lead. ChefDK also has an internal Clients
Pool team of all members have maintainership authority.

Check out [How Chef is Maintained](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc030-maintenance-policy.md#how-the-project-is-maintained) for details on the process, how to become
a maintainer, lieutenant, or the project lead.
