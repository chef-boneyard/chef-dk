# ChefDK 0.10.0

## knife-windows updated to 1.1.1
See the [knife-windows DOC_CHANGES](https://github.com/chef/knife-windows/blob/master/DOC_CHANGES.md)

## Inspec now included

Currently you must execute `bundle exec inspec` to access the `inspec` command line tool installed with the ChefDK.  This behavior will persist until we appbundle Inspec (which we plan on doing).

## ChefDK clean installation instructions

Add the [clean installation](https://github.com/chef/chef-dk#pre-release-candidates) notes to the ChefDK Installation page
