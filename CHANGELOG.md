# Chef Development Kit Changelog

# Last Release: 0.3.5
* Update Chef to 11.18.0 RC0, resolves issue with knife loading commands
  from incompatible versions installed as gems. See:
  https://github.com/opscode/chef-dk/issues/227

# 0.3.4
* Rollback appbundler to 0.2.0, resolves
  https://github.com/opscode/chef-dk/issues/228
* Update components: Berks 3.2.0, Chef 11.16.4, Bundler 1.7.5

# 0.3.3

* [**Martin Smith**](https://github.com/martinb3): Add the ability to
specify arbitrary context attributes in generators from the command
line. Attributes are specified by passing the `--generator-arg` option
to a `chef generate` command with arguments of the form `key=value`. For
example, if you pass the option `--generator-arg database=mysql`, you
can access this in generator recipes with
`ChefDK::Generator.context.database` (which will return `"mysql"` in
this example).
* Fix bug in `chef verify` when prerelease ChefSpec is installed
* Include chef-provisioning and AWS, Azure, Vagrant and Fog drivers
* Fix erchef incompatibility in `chef push`
* Search upwards for `.git` dir when generating metadata for Policyfile
  locks.

# 0.3.2

* Revert the packaged certificate bundle to the '2014.08.20' version.
This works around an issue where SSL connections to AWS would fail with
certificate validation errors. More information can be found in
[#199](https://github.com/opscode/chef-dk/issues/199).
* Enforce mode 0644 for the CA cert bundle in omnibus packaging; A
change to omnibus resulted in this file being mode 0600, preventing
non-root users from verifying SSL certificates.

# 0.3.1

* Add a generator for Policyfiles
* Fix a regression in Windows packaging; the build step to upgrade the
OpenSSL version within the package was inadvertently removed, causing
certificate validation to fail in some contexts.

# 0.3.0

* [**Robert J. Berger**](https://github.com/rberger):
  Use Gem.user_dir instead of Gem.paths.home for GEM_HOME in chef exec.
* [**the Bunny Man**](https://github.com/tbunnyman):
  Treat existence of git and skip_git flag correctly in the generators.

* Initial Release of the Policyfile feature. This feature relies on
updates to the server API before it is production-ready, though it
provides a compatibility mode for testing purposes. The Policyfile
feature is accessed via the `chef install` and `chef push` commands. See
POLICYFILE_README.md in this repo for further information about the
feature and its current limitations.
* CLI no longer dumps stack trace when given invalid options
* Update Unix ruby to 2.1.3 from 2.1.2
* Warn when embedded/bin directory exists before bin directory in ENV['PATH']

# 0.2.2

* Fix a regression where `chef generate template` fails with
  `undefined method `content_source' for #<chefdk::generator::context:0x00000003e37af8>`
  in 0.2.1

## 0.2.1

Other than some minor bug fixes, here is a list of included changes:

* Chef DK is now supported on Mac 10.8.
* Fixed a bug in `chef exec` to set the ENV correctly. This resolves errors like
  [this](https://github.com/opscode/chef-dk/issues/103) when running commands
  with `chef exec`.
* Make supermarket the default source in generated Gemfiles.
* `chef generate repo` command is now available. This command generates a chef
  repository which is equivalent to [chef-repo](https://github.com/opscode/chef-repo).
* Generators do not require Administrator privileges on Windows anymore.

## 0.2.0

### Chef Development Kit Windows Support

Version 0.2.0 of Chef Development Kit is now available as an MSI package for Windows. Supported operating system versions are:

* Windows Server 2008 R2 / Windows 7
* Windows Server 2012 / Windows 8
* Windows Server 2012 R2 / Windows 8.1

### Added `chef shell-init`
`chef shell-init SHELL_NAME` emits shell commands that modify your
environment to make ChefDK your primary ruby. For more information to
help you decide if this is desirable and instructions, see "Using ChefDK
as Your Primary Development Environment" in the README.

### Added option to generate subcommand

The 'chef generate' subcommand now has the '--generator-cookbook' option to let you
specify a path to an alternate skeleton cookbook for generating cookbooks. For an
example, look at 'lib/chef-dk/skeletons' which is the default if this option
is not specified. Your cookbook will need to be named `code_generator` in order
for the recipes to be run.

* [Add skeleton option for chef generate](https://github.com/opscode/chef-dk/pull/40) by [martinisoft](https://github.com/martinisoft)

### Added subcommand

The 'chef exec' subcommand added to execute commands with the PATH and ruby environment
of the chefdk omnibus environment (analogous to 'bundle exec').

* [chef exec](https://github.com/opscode/chef-dk/pull/22)

## Release: 0.1.0

### Berkshelf Updates

Berkshelf is updated to 3.1.1. [(Berkshelf Changelog)](https://github.com/berkshelf/berkshelf/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

* [Integration test fixes](https://github.com/opscode/chef-dk/pull/26)
* [Unit test fixes](https://github.com/opscode/chef-dk/pull/23)

### Test Kitchen Updates

ChefDK now includes the `kitchen-vagrant` driver by default. Other
drivers can be installed via `chef gem`. Additionally, Test Kitchen has
been updated to install drivers to the embedded ruby when using `kitchen init`.

* [Test Kitchen gem install fix](https://github.com/test-kitchen/test-kitchen/pull/416)
* [kitchen init bug report](https://github.com/opscode/chef-dk/issues/15)

### `verify` Command Improvements:

Runs a set of smoke tests by default; Can independently run smoke,
unit and/or integration tests.

* [chef verify patch](https://github.com/opscode/chef-dk/pull/25)
* [chef verify failure on OS X](https://github.com/opscode/chef-dk/issues/21)
* [chef verify failure as non-root](https://github.com/opscode/chef-dk/issues/13)

### `gem` Command Improvements:

Gems now install in "user" mode by default, and are installed to
`~/.chefdk/gem`. Executables will be installed to
`~/.chefdk/gem/ruby/2.1.0/bin`. See [the notes on the README](https://github.com/opscode/chef-dk#using-chefdk-as-your-primary-development-environment)
for more information about updating your environment to use ChefDK as
your primary Ruby development environment.

* [chef gem should work as non-root](https://github.com/opscode/chef-dk/issues/11)

### Improved Documentation

The README now has basic usage instructions for the `chef` command line
tool and documents how it interacts (or doesn't) with other Ruby
development tools.

* [Update README](https://github.com/opscode/chef-dk/issues/24)
* [Explain how ChefDK affects my workflow](https://github.com/opscode/chef-dk/issues/16)

### Added Tool

`chef-vault` is now a part of the default package.
